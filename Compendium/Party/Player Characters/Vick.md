### Description
Vick, the harengon sorcerer, was born under the vibrant canopy of the Feywild, a realm where the line between the whimsical and the wild is as thin as a spider's silk. His early life took a dramatic turn when he was discovered by a troupe of travelling circus performers. Enchanted by his natural charisma and innate magical abilities, they adopted him into their colourful caravan.

During his time with the carnival, Vick experienced a peculiar incident that left a permanent mark on his magical essence. In a moment of unchecked power, he accidentally severed the tether between himself and his shadow, granting it a mischievous will of its own. This unpredictable shadow became both a curse and a companion, often revealing Vick's true feelings and intentions in the most inopportune moments, much to his chagrin.
