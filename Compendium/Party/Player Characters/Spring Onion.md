### Description
Spring Onion spent his early years on the streets, running petty scams for a local crime lord. But everything changed when the Witchlight Carnival came to town. Unable to pay for admission, the young harengon raced past the ticket stand and never looked back. Several Witchlight hands gave chase, and the ensuing display of parkour convinced a veteran performer to take him under his wing.

As punishment for entering without a ticket, Spring Onion was cursed with an inability to count. But more importantly, he had found his true calling. Now, after years of training, Spring Onion is a fully-fledged, tightrope-walking, knife-juggling acrobat.

There his story might have ended, were it not for the strange recent events at the carnival. People have started to go missing, including his close friends, Hurly and Star. Spring Onion's search for clues has led him through a one-way portal to the mysterious domain of Prismeer.
