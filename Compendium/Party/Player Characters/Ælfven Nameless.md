### Description
I grew up in the wilds, far from any city, and always felt the call of nature. The ways of townfolk are a mystery to me but I care for every wild beast or growing tree.

Once, journeying in the mountains far from home, I stumbled upon the carnival and was immediately entranced by all the lights and sound and people, so unfamiliar to me. I woke the next day in a barren meadow, alone but for a headache, and ever afterwards I can never find my way home. I cannot remember the names of my family or what they look like, only occasionally the fleeting memory of a voice or the glimpse of a peaceful valley that reminds me of the life I lost.

I've been searching for my people ever since and joined the druid Circle of the Moon to hunt for clues as to where I belong. I spend my days honing my skills as a tracker and my nights roaming the woods as a wild beast, following the scent, but to no good. Now, at last, with the carnival back in town, it smells like I am close.
