### Description
When he was an infant, my mother was expelled from our dragonborn clan for a crime that she never spoke of again. His father stayed with the clan. I was supposed to remain with him but, devastated by the prospects of losing everything, my mother took me and ran away. She started a new life in a small village and raised me there. She never recovered from the expulsion however, and was apathetic and unloving. From a young age I had serious responsibilities just to get by, and when my mother died in my preteens I had to become fully self-sufficient. I found I had a knack for exploiting others and over the years mastered the art of the con, using this to survive. I learned to use the magic in my bloodline to trick others. I hate the clan for what they did to my mother and myself, and so actively reject the way of my life of most dragonborn, for whom their devotion to their clan is defining. I will survive and succeed in life just to show I don't need others. However I still share some with traits with other dragonborn, including my strong desire to fully master my craft. In addition, when I was young I snuck into a magic carnival and attempted to charm an organiser to allow me to steal from them. They turned out to be a powerful warlock however, and quickly threw me out. Ever since I have been unable to comprehend music, and instead hear it as an unpleasant cacophony, which I believe to be a curse laid on me by this warlock. I intend to go back and regain my lost enjoyment of music.
