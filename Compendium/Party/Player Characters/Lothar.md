### Description
I hail from a noble family line of demon-slayers and ruthless lords but my father's father started to show mercy on his subjects and ushered in a new age of prosperity for our family. Unfortunately my father turned his back on these ideals and ran our family name into the ground. I have abandoned my father, after years of neglect (which started when I once stole our heirloom sword Demon's Bane and lost it at the magic carnival) and embarked on a year of questing to rebuild the reputation of our lineage as set by my grandfather, and to hopefully find his fabled sword.

I am an incredible fighter and you definitely want me at the front doing all the hard work. I am the greatest asset on the team and am definitely not narcissistic or scared.
