### Description

Thalia was born to a powerful family of high elf sorcerers but exhibited no magical abilities herself. Much effort was expended trying to unlock the latent magical talents of her bloodline and, once that proved fruitless, to teach her wizardry but she never showed even a spark. Eventually her father, Aquilo Winter, and mother, Khione Winter planned to use a dangerous, potentially lethal, ritual in a last ditch attempt to reveal her magic. Her older sister, Persephone, overheard their discussions and, horrified at their dispassion for Thalia's life and willingness to risk her life to prevent the social embarrassment of a non-magical child, conspired to smuggle her to safety. 

Thalia was taken at the age of 8 to the village of Evergreen, a druid community in the middle of a vast forest. It was here she grew up, raised communally, belonging to no one specific family but welcome with all of them. She lost her taste at a fairy carnival in her childhood but despite this dreams of being a renowned chocolatier/sweet maker. A few years ago, she left her village to explore the world, to look for exotic ingredients and to take the time to perfect her sweets. Despite her lack of magical talent, Thalia has an instinctual ability to weave magic into the sweets she produces.

#### Introduction

Your first impression upon seeing Thalia Evergreen is that she makes for a very unusual elf, though, you can’t quite place why. Maybe it’s the body language - most elves hold themselves with a detached arrogance and move with a grace missing from the way she bumbles along, looking intently anywhere other than where she's going. She lacks the unnerving beauty of the elves you’ve seen before. Which is not to say she isn’t pretty, she is, but to you elves almost seem beautiful on a technicality - too symmetrical, too flawless. Like a mint condition Barbie never removed from the box, while Thalia bore the scratches and scars and scribbled pencil markings of someone who fate had taken a particular interest in.

Thalia Evergreen has the unmistakable visage of a madman. Which is not to say that she is mad; indeed, were you to look into her bright green eyes, you’d see a piercing, albeit erratic intelligence. But still, the impression of madness is hard to avoid. Her hair is cut short, and as asymmetrical as it is a-sensical. Scruffy, tucked behind her ear on one side, folding into a fringe in the middle and with strands falling down to her chin on the other - it looks like it was caught in an explosion in a hair dye factory and just sort of… stuck like that. Pinks and blues, purples and greens, one might say it was a full spectrum of colour, were that not to imply that there was some holistic consistency or gradient to its appearance where, in fact, the colours were haphazardly splashed throughout. 

Around her neck she wore a bow tie, woven of red and gold material. A definitely strange decision, but infinitely stranger is the fact it’s worn over top of an even more unusual tie. Blue and purple and most bizarrely of all, containing a watch face woven into the lower section. A watch face which, by your estimation, has the time in error by some six and half hours. And finally, and very much the finale to her apparel, was something part way between a coat and a jacket. Made from patches of bright pastel blues, yellows and pink materials sewn together with no obvious pattern. It seemed to operate in an extra dimension to most clothing, with layers folding over and over each other concealing a multitude of hidden pockets and looking almost like an optical illusion. To look at it for too long might give you a headache, although this could mainly be attributed to the frankly offensive use of colour.
