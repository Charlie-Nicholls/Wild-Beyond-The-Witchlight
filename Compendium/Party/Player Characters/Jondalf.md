### Description
I love secrets, mysteries and forbidden knowledge in general. So much so that I sometimes throw caution to the wind to try and discover something. Once, when I was younger, I even attempted to trade my soul for a really powerful spell... but the demon with whom I was bartering tricked me. I still can't cast that blasted spell! Studying in the Mage's Guild was pretty soul destroying anyway- so I'm not really sure my encounter with the demon did me as much harm as you might expect! I'm much happier now out on the road having adventures, and hopefully picking up some new magical insights along the way.
