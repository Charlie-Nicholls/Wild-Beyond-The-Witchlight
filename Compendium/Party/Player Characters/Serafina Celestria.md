### Description
Serafina is not your "ordinary" half-elf, but what half-elf is "ordinary" anyway...? She hails as the daughter of a most high female elf (a powerful sorceress), and a man of humble birth. It is because of this union that Serafina has always felt like an outsider. 

A tragic encounter at a carnival when she was very young meant Serafina lost her family. Swept into the carnival world, Serafina's only chance of survival was to learn to be an entertainer. There, she  developed gifts in entertaining through poetry, acrobatics, dance and singing, as well using her innate sorcery in the illusionary arts. But don't be fooled by her being a most charming half-elf and entertainer; Serafina  is also an adept fighter, believing in fighting for the lawful good, just like the gold-dragon hero of her source origin.  Outspoken, she speaks her truth, so don't be on her bad side... you may very well get burnt to a crisp by her fiery words.
