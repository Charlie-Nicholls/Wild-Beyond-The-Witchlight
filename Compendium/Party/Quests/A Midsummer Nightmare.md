### Description
[[Hotel Midsummer]] was once a popular stop off for travellers in the [[Feywild]], boasting the ability to let you live your dream. The hotel's patron, [[The Sandman]], would collect a dream as you slept, which would then be brought to life in your room, ready for you to experience when you wake. It would then be kept alive in that room forever as payment, and you would never be able to dream it again. [[Hotel Midsummer]] requires a regular supply of new dreams to keep it alive. It's said the twisting space of the hotel's interior goes on forever; that everyone has a room ready for them somewhere.

But [[Hotel Midsummer]] has become trapped inside [[The Gem]], the guests within unable to leave and no new dreamers able to arrive. Over time the hotel has become increasingly desperate to maintain itself. Feeding over and over again on the same guests, taking more and more dreams from them. Eventually it had no choice but to start using nightmares, this power source has steadily corrupted the hotel; turning it from a vibrant place of joy to a twisting corridor of horrors. The guests have long since run out of dreams, causing them to lose the ability to sleep. Those who die from lack of sleep can find themselves trapped in [[Gem Shards]] if any were in their room. These unfortunate souls become trapped as [[The Echoes]], forced to relive their dreams or nightmares until they can change the outcome.

Those who find themselves in the halls of [[Hotel Midsummer]] are pursued relentlessly by [[The Sandman]]. A creature which can only be seen when your eyes are closed, who sends to sleep any who he touches. In his time here he has learned the nature of the gem and believes the hotel can at last escape, if only he had a few more dreams to power the attempt. But, with the hotel infested with nightmares and far beyond saving, this would surely result only more people becoming ensnared, and the horrors held within escaping into the [[Feywild]].

### Concept + Ideas

The Sandman chases them through the hotel. Each time they pass through a room it will be representing an amalgamation of a persons dreams and nightmares. They will have to describe how they use skill checks/spells/abilities/role play to navigate the room and keep away from The Sandman. If they fail to navigate a room properly (e.g. fail 3/5 checks required), The Sandman will catch one of them and touch them. This will send them to sleep and allow him to steal one of their dreams. Usually The Sandman can only be seen with your eyes closed, and while asleep they are able to fully see and speak to The Sandman if they wish. Have them describe a frequent dream or nightmare their character has that he steals. The Sandman will then retreat to weave the dream into the hotel, giving the players a chance to wake the sleeping player and recuperate. We then time skip to the next time he appears and repeat until they are teleported into the next room of the gem.

- To signal his arrival initially before players work out they need to close their eyes to see him, play Mr Sandman coming from speakers in the hallways. (Unless they're in rooms then they can't hear it) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuEllCbjbVc&list=RDMMtuEllCbjbVc

- The Sandman requires a certain number of dreams to power the Hotel enough to escape, totalled across the three, else the hotel will soon die out completely.
- If anyone has a dream stolen, they, or a future group, can later find the room it is in.
- Some way to get puzzle pieces, scattered around the rooms and/or from helping the restless?
- Give them a brochure (physical prop) + pencil to allow them to write messages to the next team. 
	- Start with it in the hand of a dead guest who's written something like "Don't let him touch you" on a section about The Sandman. 
	- If they realise they can write messages to the next team then let them write whatever they want. If they don't, prompt whoever has it as they're being teleported out that they realise they can leave something for the next people to end up there. Ask them to dictate what they want to write, then roll something like 2d20 + 10 to see how many characters they can write before they're teleported out.

### Room Ideas
 - Remember to use the interactives principle to describe rooms
 - Some of the rooms are the leftovers of the long dead, some contain the [[The Echoes]].
	 - Try to make the [[The Echoes]] heart breaking
	 - [[The Echoes]] are trapped in [[Gem Shards]], helping them move on will reveal the shards and allow the players to collect them.
 - Three main types of rooms, chase, challenge and echo rooms.
	 - Chase rooms are easier to navigate but will have them being closely perused by [[The Sandman]], having to find ways to slow him down or get through quickly
	 - Challenged focused rooms present some obstacle to exiting the room that has to be overcome, use one of these when they get away from [[The Sandman]] to justify him catching up
	 - Echo Rooms can be either chase or challenge rooms but contain an echo of a former guest who presents a side quest that will reward them with an additional 9 [[Gem Shards]] if they complete.
 - If [[The Sandman]] steals any of the party's dreams, these can appear as chase or challenge rooms later

**Challenge Rooms**

bard with stage fright, generic monster, fear of places e.g. elemental planes, monster pit e.g. scorpians

> [!recite|nbrd no-i] Bottomless Pit
> - Infinite falling loop
> - Have to make it to the other side
>

> [!recite|nbrd no-i] Claustrophobia and Caving
> - Crawl through a maze of tight spaces

> - Exit door at the base of a waterfall

> [!recite|nbrd no-i] Lost in Camarath
> - End up in a city, with an intense feeling like they're late and need to get to the city center
> - Hard to navigate, maps make no sense.
> - Can do stuff like moving feeling like it's not getting you anywhere, space wrapping back on itself
> - City is split into 3 concentric walled sections that can mark progress

**Echo Rooms**

> [!recite|nbrd no-i] Fiery Voyage
> - Find themselves on a boat navigating a sea of fire
> - [[The Echoes|Echo]] of Captain Bill Ironheart (Personality of Bill Seacaster)
> 	- This is a dream of something that happened in his past
> 	- Unclear if it is a dream or nightmare, he clearly loves the danger but lost a lot of crew in the journey
> 	- Saving enough of his crew will free him from being an [[The Echoes|Echo]] and reward them with [[Gem Shards]]
> - Environmental challenges
> 	- Lava geysers
> 	- Falling rocks from volcanic islands
> 	- Firestorms on the wind
> - Pilot the boat towards the land where the door is on the beach

> [!recite|nbrd no-i] Zamvol's Presentation
> - Something funny like a nerdy orc's nightmare about having to give a presentation on a new axe/hunting method they came up with to a tribe of classic jocks
> - [[The Echoes|Echo]] of Zamvol The Useless
> 	- Clever but weak and shy Orc
> 	- Has designed a new axe with magic infused that keeps it sharper and more durable
> - Dream character of Grug The Skullsplitter, orc chieftan 
> - Social skills focused
> - Not able to leave until the presentation is finished or the door is just painted on.
> 	- Hiding or Fitting in as people in the dream to trick [[The Sandman]]
> 	- Or can help out [[The Echoes|The Echo]] in the room which will gain [[Gem Shards]] and allow the door to open early
> 		- Helping can look like having them not care about the opinions of the others or convincing the others it's a great idea

### Chase Mechanics

> [!recite|nbrd no-i] Chase Track
> - When a chase begins, [[The Sandman]] and the players are placed on the chase track, with the players slightly ahead. (tile 9 vs 1, target 21)
> - The players and [[The Sandman]] then alternate turns. With the players taking 2 turns for every 1 of [[The Sandman]].
> - The track does not only represent physical distance, but the "advantage" the players have over [[The Sandman]] in the chase, so, for example, being hidden, putting obstacles in his way or learning useful information are represented by the distance on the track but don't have a physical distance in of themselves.
> - Players can not take damage from the dreams, but they will still feel the pain or effects until they leave the room. Instead of damage, these effects are measured on the Chase Track
> - The players may either make a group check (use the mean) or have someone make an individual check. If a player makes an individual check, they cannot do so again until the others have made individual checks. (Can also do for example a pair check, take average, both players must wait till the other two make a pair or two individual checks before they can go again.)
> - Refer to the Risk/Reward-Difficulty table to determine the movement that occurs during a players turn.
> - [[The Sandman]] on his turn makes his own check and rolls on the following table:
>> [!recite|clean no-t]
>> | Score | 1-8 | 9-18 | 19-20
>> |  :---: | :---: |   :---: |  :---: |
>> | **Movement** | 1 | 2 | 3 |
>
>> [!recite|clean no-i] Extra D6s
> - When rounding corners on the chase track there are two types of D6s that are rolled
> - Between the players and the exit is are two D6 representing [[Gem Shards]], if players pass this point they can roll the D6 + 3 to determine how many [[Gem Shards]] they find.
>	- If they are caught by [[The Sandman]] before reaching this point he will instead steal the remaining [[Gem Shards]]
> - Between [[The Sandman]] and the players starting point are a further two Fate Dice that he rolls to affect the dream itself.
>	- [[The Sandman]] takes an additional action on the following table and the players make a saving throw of the stated DC. If they can justify using another ability instead of a saving throw allow it.
>	- [[The Sandman]] moves forward an amount equal to the number of players who failed the save.
>
>> [!recite|clean no-t]
>> | Roll | - |   | + |
>> |  :---: | :---: |  :---: |  :---: |
>> | **Save DC** | 8 | 12 | 16 |

> [!recite|nbrd no-i] Risk/Reward-Difficulty Levels
> - Whenever a player makes some attempt to speed up their escape or slow down [[The Sandman]], judge the risk-reward level and difficulty and use the following table to determine how many shifts of movement they get. A success moves them forward and a failure moves [[The Sandman]] closer.
> - Let the players know that that there is a risk/reward-difficulty table so they can strategize how risky or hard the thing they want to do is, but not what exactly the table looks like.
>> [!recite|clean no-t]
>> | RR\Diff | Low | Medium | High | | Low (avg) | Medium (avg) | High (avg) |
>> |  :---: | :---: |  :---: |  :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |  :---: |
>> | **Low** | DC12 +1/-0 | - | DC18 +2/-0 | | 0.7 | 1 | 0.81 |
>> | **Medium** | DC10 +1/-1 | DC16 +2/-1 | DC18 +3/-1 | | 0.6 | 0.5 | 0.55 |
>> | **High** | DC14 +2/-2 | DC16 +3/-2 | DC20 +4/-3 | | 0.4 | 0.3 | -1 |
> - The Chase track can also be used over multiple rooms if they reach the natural end of a room without either escaping or being caught
> - If the Chase track is taking too long to complete, instead try starting the players at position 5 instead of 9 and giving both players and The Sandman a default +1 to all movement. Ignoring the starting conditions this could also be adjusted mid chase by adding 1 to both movements. Since players don't see the tables being rolled on they won't know this is a change.
> - [[The Sandman]] has an AC of 16 and any attempt to attack him counts as medium difficulty on the RR/Diff table. 
> 	- Attacking can also be considered Medium-Low (DC 16 +2/-0) if the player makes some sacrifice to make the attack, e.g. using a spell slot. This is also the default for effects that require [[The Sandman]] to make a saving throw.
> 	- Medium-Medium is used when unsure.
> 	- Medium-High is usually used for melee attacks that require a player to approach [[The Sandman]] to attack them.
