### Description
[[Hotel Midsummer]] was once a popular stop off for travellers in the [[Feywild]], boasting the ability to let you live your dream. The hotel's patron, [[The Sandman]], would collect a dream as you slept, which would then be brought to life in your room, ready for you to experience when you wake. It would then be kept alive in that room forever as payment, and you would never be able to dream it again. [[Hotel Midsummer]] requires a regular supply of new dreams to keep it alive. It's said the twisting space of the hotel's interior goes on forever; that everyone has a room ready for them somewhere.

But [[Hotel Midsummer]] has become trapped inside [[The Gem]], the guests within unable to leave and no new dreamers able to arrive. Over time the hotel has become increasingly desperate to maintain itself. Feeding over and over again on the same guests, taking more and more dreams from them. Eventually it had no choice but to start using nightmares, this power source has steadily corrupted the hotel; turning it from a vibrant place of joy to a twisting corridor of horrors. The guests have long since run out of dreams, causing them to lose the ability to sleep - killing mortals and driving fey creatures to a madness of exhaustion. Some of them still roam the hotel as [[The Restless]].

Those who find themselves in the halls of [[Hotel Midsummer]] are pursued relentlessly by [[The Sandman]]. A creature which can only be seen when your eyes are closed, who sends to sleep any who he touches. In his time here he has learned the nature of the gem and believes the hotel can at last escape, if only he had a few more dreams to power the attempt. But, with the hotel infested with nightmares and far beyond saving, this would surely result only more people becoming ensnared, and the horrors held within escaping into the [[Feywild]].

### Concept + Ideas

The Sandman chases them through the hotel. Each time they pass through a room it will be representing an amalgamation of a persons dreams and nightmares. They will have to describe how they use skill checks/spells/abilities/role play to navigate the room and keep away from The Sandman. If they fail to navigate a room properly (e.g. fail 3/5 checks required), The Sandman will catch one of them and touch them. This will send them to sleep and allow him to steal one of their dreams. Usually The Sandman can only be seen with your eyes closed, and while asleep they are able to fully see and speak to The Sandman if they wish. Have them describe a frequent dream or nightmare their character has that he steals. The Sandman will then retreat to weave the dream into the hotel, giving the players a chance to wake the sleeping player and recuperate. We then time skip to the next time he appears and repeat until they are teleported into the next room of the gem.

- To signal his arrival initially before players work out they need to close their eyes to see him, play Mr Sandman coming from speakers in the hallways. (Unless they're in rooms then they can't hear it) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuEllCbjbVc&list=RDMMtuEllCbjbVc

- The Sandman requires a certain number of dreams to power the Hotel enough to escape, totalled across the three, else the hotel will soon die out completely.
- If anyone has a dream stolen, they, or a future group, can later find the room it is in.
- Some way to get puzzle pieces, scattered around the rooms and/or from helping the restless?
- Give them a brochure (physical prop) + pencil to allow them to write messages to the next team. 
	- Start with it in the hand of a dead guest who's written something like "Don't let him touch you" on a section about The Sandman. 
	- If they realise they can write messages to the next team then let them write whatever they want. If they don't, prompt whoever has it as they're being teleported out that they realise they can leave something for the next people to end up there. Ask them to dictate what they want to write, then roll something like 2d20 + 10 to see how many characters they can write before they're teleported out.

### Room Ideas
 - Remember to use the interactives principle to describe rooms
 - Some of the rooms are the leftovers of the long dead, some contain [[The Restless]], but perhaps the most horrifying are [[The Echoes]].
	 - Try to make [[The Restless]] scary and [[The Echoes]] heart breaking
	 - [[The Echoes]] are trapped in [[Gem Shards]], helping them move on will reveal the shards and allow the players to collect them.
 - Two main types of rooms, chase focused and challenge focused.
	 - Challenged focused rooms present some obstacle to exiting the room that has to be overcome, use one of these when they get away from [[The Sandman]] to justify him catching up
	 - Chase rooms are easier to navigate but will have them being closely perused by [[The Sandman]], having to find ways to slow him down or get through quickly

**Challenge Rooms**

bard with stage fright, generic monster, fear of places e.g. elemental planes

> [!recite|nbrd no-i] Falling
> - Infinite falling loop
> - Have to make it to the other side
>

> [!recite|nbrd no-i] Claustrophobia
> - Crawl through a maze of tight spaces
> - Then when they get to open space have walls close in, door in hard to reach location or hidden

**Chase Rooms**

> [!recite|nbrd no-i] Presentation
> - Something funny like a nerdy orc's nightmare about having to give a presentation on a new axe/hunting method they came up with to a tribe of classic jocks
> - Use one of [[The Echoes]] here. 
> - Social skills focused
> - Not able to leave until the presentation is finished or the door is just painted on.
> 	- Hiding or Fitting in as people in the dream to trick [[The Sandman]]
> 	- Or can help out [[The Echoes|The Echo]] in the room which will gain [[Gem Shards]] and allow the door to open early
> 		- Helping can look like having them not care about the opinions of the others or convincing the others it's a great idea

> [!recite|nbrd no-i] Getting Lost
> - End up in a city, somehow knowing where they need to go to find the exit (echo or restless or just an inherent feeling from the dream?)
> - Hard to navigate, maps make no sense.
> - Can do stuff like moving feeling like it's not getting you anywhere, space wrapping back on itself
