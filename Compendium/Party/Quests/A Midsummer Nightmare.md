### Description
At the age of 10, [[Summer Night]] ran away from home and got lost in the [[Feywild]]. She made a deal with a hag, who gave her the power to make her dreams a reality, but in return cursed her to die the next time she woke. Her first dream was of [[The Sandman]], a creature that would tend to her while she slept. His right hand is clenched in a fist, through which runs sand that represents how long [[Summer Night|Summer]] has before she runs out of dreams and wakes. In his left he holds a dream-catcher, which he can use on the sleeping to steal their dreams and bring them to [[Summer Night|Summer]] to give to her. 

After a while she would dream of [[Hotel Midsummer]] which quickly became a popular stop off for travellers in the [[Feywild]], boasting the ability to let you live your dream. [[The Sandman]] would collect a dream as you slept and bring it to [[Summer Night|Summer]], weaving it into the dream of the hotel. It is then be brought to life in your room, ready for you to experience when you wake and allowing [[Summer Night|Summer]] to continue to sleep and live in the dreams of others. The dream is kept alive in that room forever as payment, and you would never be able to dream it again. It's said the twisting space of the hotel's interior goes on forever; that everyone has a room ready for them somewhere.

But [[Summer Night|Summer]] and her [[Hotel Midsummer|Hotel]] have become trapped inside [[The Gem]], the guests within unable to leave and no new dreamers able to arrive. Over time [[The Sandman]] has become increasingly desperate to keep [[Summer Night|Summer]] dreaming. Feeding over and over again on the same guests, taking more and more dreams from them. Eventually he had no choice but to start using nightmares, this power source has steadily corrupted the hotel; turning it from a vibrant place of joy to a twisting corridor of horrors. The guests have long since run out of dreams, causing them to lose the ability to sleep. Those who die from lack of sleep can find themselves trapped in [[The Gem#Gem Shards]], if any were in their room. These unfortunate souls become [[The Echoes]], forced to relive their dreams or nightmares until they can change the outcome.

Those who find themselves in the halls of [[Hotel Midsummer]] are pursued relentlessly by [[The Sandman]]. A creature which can only be seen when your eyes are closed, who sends to sleep any who he touches. In his time here he has learned the nature of the gem and believes they can at last escape, if only he can collect a few more [[The Gem#Gem Shards]] to finish his teleportation device, before [[Summer Night|Summer]] wakes up. But, with the hotel infested with nightmares and far beyond saving, this would surely result only more people becoming ensnared, and the horrors held within escaping into the [[Feywild]]. But [[Summer Night|Summer]] is tired and scared, living in an endless nightmare. Would she even want to be saved if he could?

### The Sandman
> [!recite|clean no-t]
>	Long thin legs seem to make up the majority of his height with only a small torso attached. Inhumanly spindly arms reach out twice as far as is comfortable from body, each with two elbows that allow it to bend in either direction. One had is perpetually clenched into a fist, with a constant trickle of sand falling between his fingers, marking a path of dust wherever he treads. In the other is a circle of thread, woven into an intricate pattern, with several black feathers tied to the rim. He wears a dark cloak, draped loosely over his almost insect like body, and those unlucky enough to catch a glimpse under his dark hood would see his eyes are sewn shut.

If [[The Sandman]] touches any of the players, he will steal one of their dreams and they take a level of exhaustion.

When [[The Sandman]] first appears play the following  [music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuEllCbjbVc). Slowing increasing the volume until the players notice.

### Rooms
 - Some of the rooms are the leftovers of the long dead, some contain the [[The Echoes]].
	 - Try to make the [[The Echoes]] heart breaking
	 - [[The Echoes]] are trapped in [[The Gem#Gem Shards]], helping them move on will reveal 10 shards and allow the players to collect them.
 - Three types of rooms, chase, challenge and echo rooms.
	 - Chase rooms are easier to navigate but will have them being closely perused by [[The Sandman]], having to find ways to slow him down or get through quickly
	 - Challenged focused rooms present some obstacle to exiting the room that has to be overcome, use one of these when they get away from [[The Sandman]] to justify him catching up
	 - Echo Rooms can be either chase or challenge rooms but contain an echo of a former guest, players who successfully help them get rewarded with extra [[The Gem#Gem Shards]]
 - If [[The Sandman]] steals any of the party's dreams, these can appear as chase or challenge rooms later
 - Rooms can lead into each other or back into the corridor at the DMs discretion, usually into the corridor only after a chase track has been completed.
 - Below are some examples of rooms but more can be created easily. Most are based off common nightmares, but they could be nicer dreams from past guests as long as they present an interesting challenge a chase with [[The Sandman]].

> [!recite|nbrd no-i] Bottomless Pit (Challenge)
> - Infinite falling loop
> - Have to make it to the other side

> [!recite|nbrd no-i] Claustrophobia and Caving (Challenge or Chase)
> - Crawl through a maze of tight spaces
> - Then when they get to open space have walls close in, door in hard to reach location or hidden

> [!recite|nbrd no-i] Ravine of Monsters (Challenge or Chase)
> - Have to make your way through a ravine, full of monsters
> - Exit on the other side

> [!recite|nbrd no-i] Endless Ocean (Chase)
> - Dropped in the deep ocean
> - Something trying to drag you down and drown you
> - Exit door at the base of a waterfall

> [!recite|nbrd no-i] Lost in Camarath (Chase)
> - End up in a city, with an intense feeling like they're late and need to get to the city centre
> - Hard to navigate, maps make no sense.
> - Can do stuff like moving feeling like it's not getting you anywhere, space wrapping back on itself
> - City is split into 3 concentric walled sections that can mark progress

> [!recite|nbrd no-i] Fiery Voyage (Chase and Echo)
> - Find themselves on a boat navigating a sea of fire
> - [[The Echoes|Echo]] of Captain [[The Echoes#Bill Ironheart]]
> 	- This is a dream of something that happened in his past
> 	- Unclear if it is a dream or nightmare, he clearly loves the danger but lost a lot of crew in the journey
> 	- Saving enough of his crew will free him from being an [[The Echoes|Echo]] and reward them with [[The Gem#Gem Shards]]
> - Environmental challenges
> 	- Lava geysers
> 	- Falling rocks from volcanic islands
> 	- Firestorms on the wind
> - Pilot the boat towards the land where the door is on the beach

> [!recite|nbrd no-i] Zamvol's Presentation (Echo)
> - Something funny like a nerdy orc's nightmare about having to give a presentation on a new axe/hunting method they came up with to a tribe of classic jocks
> - [[The Echoes|Echo]] of [[The Echoes#Zamvol The Useless]]
> 	- Clever but weak and shy Orc
> 	- Has designed a new axe with magic infused that keeps it sharper and more durable
> - Dream character of Grug The Skullsplitter, orc chieftan 
> - Social skills focused
> - Not able to leave until the presentation is finished or the door is just painted on.
> 	- Hiding or Fitting in as people in the dream to trick [[The Sandman]]
> 	- Or can help out [[The Echoes|The Echo]] in the room which will gain [[The Gem#Gem Shards]] and allow the door to open early
> 		- Helping can look like having them not care about the opinions of the others or convincing the others it's a great idea

### Chase Mechanics

> [!recite|nbrd no-i] Chase Track
> - When a chase begins, [[The Sandman]] and the players are placed on the chase track, with the players slightly ahead. (tile 9 vs 1, target 21)
> - The players and [[The Sandman]] then alternate turns. Starting with the players taking a turn, then [[The Sandman]], after which the players take 2 turns for every 1 of [[The Sandman]]. 
> - The track does not only represent physical distance, but the "advantage" the players have over [[The Sandman]] in the chase, so, for example, being hidden, putting obstacles in his way or learning useful information are represented by the distance on the track but don't have a physical distance in of themselves.
> - Players can not take damage from the dreams, but they will still feel the pain or effects until they leave the room. Instead of damage, these effects are measured on the Chase Track
> - The players may either make a group check or have someone make an individual check. If a player makes an individual check, they cannot do so again until the others have made individual checks. (Can also do for example a pair or trio check, players must wait till the others make a checks of their own before they can make non-group checks.)
> - Refer to the Risk/Reward-Difficulty table to determine the movement that occurs during a players turn.
> - [[The Sandman]] on his turn makes his own check and rolls on the following table:
>> [!recite|clean no-t]
>> | Score | 1-8 | 9-18 | 19-20
>> |  :---: | :---: |   :---: |  :---: |
>> | **Movement** | 1 | 2 | 3 |
>
>> [!recite|clean no-i] Extra D6s
> - When rounding corners on the chase track there are two types of D6s that are rolled
> - Between the players and the exit is are two D6 representing [[The Gem#Gem Shards]], if players pass this point they can roll the D6 + 3 to determine how many [[The Gem#Gem Shards]] they find.
>	- If they are caught by [[The Sandman]] before reaching this point he will instead steal the remaining [[The Gem#Gem Shards]]
> - Between [[The Sandman]] and the players starting point are a further two D3s that he rolls to affect the dream itself.
>	- [[The Sandman]] takes an additional action on the following table and the players make a saving throw of the stated DC. Can be flexible and do a forced ability check instead of a saving throw.
>	- [[The Sandman]] moves forward an amount equal to the number of players who failed the save.
>
>> [!recite|clean no-t]
>> | Roll | "-" (1/2) | " " (3/4) | "+" (5/6) |
>> |  :---: | :---: |  :---: |  :---: |
>> | **Save DC** | 8 | 12 | 16 |

> [!recite|nbrd no-i] Risk/Reward-Difficulty Levels
> - Whenever a player makes some attempt to speed up their escape or slow down [[The Sandman]], judge the risk-reward level and difficulty and use the following table to determine how many shifts of movement they get. A success moves them forward and a failure moves [[The Sandman]] closer.
> - Let the players know that that there is a risk/reward-difficulty table so they can strategize how risky or hard the thing they want to do is, but not what exactly the table looks like.
>> [!recite|clean no-t]
>> | RR\Diff | Low | Medium | High | | Low (avg) | Medium (avg) | High (avg) |
>> |  :---: | :---: |  :---: |  :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |  :---: |
>> | **Low** | DC12 +1/-0 | - | DC18 +2/-0 | | 0.7 | 1 | 0.81 |
>> | **Medium** | DC10 +1/-1 | DC16 +2/-1 | DC18 +3/-1 | | 0.6 | 0.5 | 0.55 |
>> | **High** | DC14 +2/-2 | DC16 +3/-2 | DC20 +4/-3 | | 0.4 | 0.3 | -1 |
> - The Chase track can also be used over multiple rooms if they reach the natural end of a room without either escaping or being caught
> - If the Chase track is taking too long to complete, instead try starting the players at position 5 instead of 9 and giving both players and The Sandman a default +1 to all movement. Ignoring the starting conditions this could also be adjusted mid chase by adding 1 to both movements. Since players don't see the tables being rolled on they won't know this is a change.
> - [[The Sandman]] has an AC of 16 and any attempt to attack him counts as medium difficulty on the RR/Diff table. 
> 	- Attacking can also be considered Medium-Low (DC 16 +2/-0) if the player makes some sacrifice to make the attack, e.g. using a spell slot. This is also the default for effects that require [[The Sandman]] to make a saving throw.
> 	- Attacks made against [[The Sandman]] have disadvantage if the player does not close their eyes. Though closing their eyes for this can result in disadvantage on other rolls.
> 	- Medium-Medium is used when unsure.
> 	- Medium-High is usually used for melee attacks that require a player to approach [[The Sandman]] to attack them.

### Start
- Describe them dreaming about being [[Summer Night]], running through a forest and finding a pool of water through which the [[Feywild]] can be seen. A shadowy figure in a cloak can be seen in the pool, when they enter the pool they wake.
	- This is the night she ran away from home and made a deal to bring her dreams to life.
	- Shadowy figure is the hag she makes a deal with, but the description looks similar to the [[The Sandman]].
- The first room they enter is a lavish bed room with an enormous oversized bed at its centre. In the middle of the bed is the body of a gnome.
- If they get close enough they can see he is holding brochure with "DON'T LET HIM TOUCH YOU" scrawled across it, sketches of various runes.
- A DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check reveals on of the rune is a magical magnification and the other is an polarity reverser
- A DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) check on the body shows he has signs of exhaustion, but no wounds.
- At this point they hear a scuffle from beneath the bed. Read:

> [!recite|clean no-t]
>	You hear a muffled scuffling sound coming from beneath you. It's probably nothing dangerous, but you realise you forgot something. You see, there are two types of people who check underneath the bed before they go to sleep. Children, because they're naïve enough to think there might be monsters under the bed, and adventurers, because they're experienced enough to know that there might be monsters under the bed. You forgot to check under the bed.
>^StartMonster

- Looking under the bed will reveal an unnatural level of darkness. At this point [[The Sandman]] and his music starts echoing in from the corridor.
- [[Summer Night]] is under the bed, and a DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check or dark vision will let them see her and she will ask for their help before an invisible monster grabs her, drags her further under the bed and she leaves the dream room. If they try to follow her, a door leading to a room of your choice can be found under the bed.
- If they go into the corridor before [[The Sandman]] reaches them, they will be chased down until the hotel manipulates its interior to lead them at a dead end with two or three doors they can look through before they choose which to enter.

### End
- When they reach sufficient [[The Gem#Gem Shards]], they start to glow when pointing towards reception. Or they can locate reception in some other way, e.g. travelling down hallways in the direction of lower numbered doors.
- [[Summer Night|Summer]] will tell them to find reception if spoken to.
- If session time runs out before sufficient gems have been collected, they will be expelled from [[The Gem]] without saving [[Summer Night]]
#### Reception
- Here are a bunch more [[The Gem#Gem Shards]] laid out in the shape of the magnification rune, and a partially completed polarity reversal rune.
- [[The Echoes#Warwin Squiggle]], the [[The Echoes|Echo]] of a gnomish wizard who was trapped here. 
	- Before his death he learned about [[Summer Night]] and was determined to find a way to save her. 
	- He used the natural magic of the [[The Gem#Gem Shards]] to trap people along with a magnification rune to bring in more people to give [[The Sandman]] more dreams to extend [[Summer Night|Summer]]'s life while he worked on the reversal rune. 
	- He finished the rune and scribbled it on the back of the leaflet the players found, and succumbed to exhaustion when out looking for the final [[The Gem#Gem Shards]] he needed. This is the body they found at the start.
	- He is now one of [[The Echoes]], trapped in a loop of bringing people in and trying to finish his rune and obtain the [[The Gem#Gem Shards]] he needs to finish.
	- He will be put at peace when shown the completed runes and [[The Gem#Gem Shards]] gathered by the players. His illusion of life beginning to break down as the players finish the story.
- [[Summer Night]] is in a bed in a staff room behind the reception desk. When the players get here, [[The Sandman]] will enter or already be in this room protecting [[Summer Night|Summer]].
- [[The Sandman]]'s sand will be running low to indicate she is running out of dreams. If the players donate a dream, whoever is asleep will be able to speak to [[The Sandman]].
- Anyone awake will be able to speak to [[Summer Night]] by entering any room, room 1, the nearest room to reception, is the dream of [[Summer Night|Summer]] running through a forest, entering the [[Feywild]] and meeting a hag.
