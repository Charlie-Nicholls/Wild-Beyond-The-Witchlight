Different conditions based on how each group do, or the sandman requires a certain number of dreams to escape totalled across the three.

Some way to get puzzle pieces, scattered around the rooms and/or from helping the restless?

### Description
[[Hotel Midsummer]] was once a popular stop off for travellers in the [[Feywild]]. It boasted the ability to let you live your dreams. The hotel's patron, [[The Sandman]], would collect your dream as you slept. The dream would then be brought to life in your room, ready for you to experience when you wake. The dream would be kept as payment, and you would never be able to dream it again. [[Hotel Midsummer]] requires a regular supply of new dreams to power the magic. It is said the twisting space of the hotel's interior goes on forever, keeping the dreams alive, and that everyone has a room ready for them somewhere.

But [[Hotel Midsummer]] has become trapped inside [[The Gem]], it's guests trapped within and no new dreamers able to arrive. Over time the hotel has become increasingly desperate to maintain itself. Feeding over and over again on the same guests, taking more and more dreams from them. Eventually it had no choice but to start using nightmares, this power source has steadily corrupted the hotel; turning it from a vibrant place of joy to a twisting corridor of horrors. Trapped guests have long since been exhausted, causing a loss of the ability to sleep - killing mortals and driving fey creatures to madness. Some of them still roam the hotel as [[The Restless]].

Those who find themselves in the halls of [[Hotel Midsummer]] will find themselves pursued by [[The Sandman]]. He seeks to steal their dreams to power the hotel's escape, but with the hotel beyond saving, this would surely result only more people becoming ensnared, and the horrors held within escaping into the [[Feywild]].
