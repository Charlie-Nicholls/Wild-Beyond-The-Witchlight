### Description
[[Hotel Midsummer]] was once a popular stop off for travellers in the [[Feywild]]. It boasted the ability to let you live your dreams. The hotel's patron, [[The Sandman]], would collect your dream as you slept. The dream would then be brought to life in your room, ready for you to experience when you wake. The dream would be kept as payment, and you would never be able to dream it again. [[Hotel Midsummer]] requires a regular supply of new dreams to power the magic. It is said the twisting space of the hotel's interior goes on forever, keeping the dreams alive, and that everyone has a room ready for them somewhere.

But [[Hotel Midsummer]] has become trapped inside [[The Gem]], it's guests trapped within and no new dreamers able to arrive. Over time the hotel has become increasingly desperate to maintain itself. Feeding over and over again on the same guests, taking more and more dreams from them. Eventually it had no choice but to start using nightmares, this power source has steadily corrupted the hotel; turning it from a vibrant place of joy to a twisting corridor of horrors. Trapped guests have long since been exhausted, causing a loss of the ability to sleep - killing mortals and driving fey creatures to madness. Some of them still roam the hotel as [[The Restless]].

Those who find themselves in the halls of [[Hotel Midsummer]] are pursued by [[The Sandman]]. He seeks to steal their dreams for a last ditch attempt to power the hotel's escape. But with the hotel infested with nightmares and far beyond saving, this would surely result only more people becoming ensnared, and the horrors held within escaping into the [[Feywild]].

### Concept + Ideas

The Sandman chases them through the hotel. Each time they pass through a room it will be representing an amalgamation of a persons dreams and nightmares. They will have to describe how they use skill checks/spells/abilities/role play to navigate the room and keep away from The Sandman. If they fail to navigate a room properly (e.g. fail 3/5 checks required), The Sandman will catch one of them and touch them. This will send them to sleep and allow him to steal one of their dreams. Usually The Sandman can only be seen with your eyes closed, and while asleep they are able to fully see and speak to The Sandman if they wish. Have them describe a frequent dream or nightmare their character has that he steals. The Sandman will then retreat to weave the dream into the hotel, giving the players a chance to wake the sleeping player and recuperate. We then time skip to the next time he appears and repeat until they are teleported into the next room of the gem.

- To signal his arrival even when he can't be seen., play Mr Sandman as if it's echoing down the hallway (probably v2): [Version 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oao_grQWeXY) or [Version 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuEllCbjbVc)

- The Sandman requires a certain number of dreams to power the Hotel enough ro escape, totalled across the three, else the hotel will soon die out completely.
- Some way to get puzzle pieces, scattered around the rooms and/or from helping the restless?
- Give them a brochure (physical prop) + pencil to allow them to write messages to the next team. 
	- Start with it in the hand of a dead guest who's written something like "Don't let him touch you" on a section about The Sandman. 
	- If they realise they can write messages to the next team then let them write whatever they want.If they don't, prompt whoever has it as they're being teleported out that they realise they can leave something for the next people to end up there. Ask them to dictate what they want to write, then roll something like 2d20 + 10 to see how many characters they can write before they're teleported out.
