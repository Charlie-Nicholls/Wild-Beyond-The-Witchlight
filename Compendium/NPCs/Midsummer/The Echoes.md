### Description
Perhaps the most existentially horrifying  Mortals who died in a room with [[Gem Shards]] can have their soul become trapped in the shards. They then end up living in the dream of the room endlessly. They act like they are asleep and dreaming, with memories of their real life, including their death, accessible but distant. Unable to form new long term memories they seem to live out the same dream or nightmare endlessly.

If they can be helped to break the narrative of the dream, they can be made to remember their situation and in doing so their soul will be able to leave the gem. When the dream sequence breaks stuff begins to slip through, usually first an unexpected feeling of intense tiredness, which will make little sense to them as they feel like they're already asleep.
