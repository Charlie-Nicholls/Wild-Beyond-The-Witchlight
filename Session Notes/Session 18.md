### Plan
Plan for the session here.

### Notes
- Thalia & Pippin do an excellent job of herding the children through the forest towards the ring of mushrooms with help from Pippin's new pseudodragon familiar Tinkerbell the Noseless
- Sarvithas, Brok, Spring Onion & Mishka attempt to flee into the forest but are followed by Cradlefall + 2 redcaps
- Spring Onion + Mishka successfully hide
- Sarvithash + Brok attempt to convince him they didn't come from Loomlurch with terrible terrible lies that don't convince him but do confuse him
- Sarvithash + Brok play cards with a redcap, winning the game, it was so angry that it lose that it instantly died
- Pippin sends Noseless to find Will of the Feywild with a note telling him we have rescued some children and where to find us
- Thalia examines the magical circle and determines that we're in a Demiplane (domain of delight), with an initial magical source being overtaken by a new strain now dominating it.
- The trio manage to kill the other red cap with relative ease, leaving the area before the dragon returns
