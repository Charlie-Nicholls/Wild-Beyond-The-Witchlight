### Plan
Plan for the session here.

### Notes
- Thalia & Pippin do an excellent job of herding the children through the forest towards the ring of mushrooms with help from Pippin's new pseudodragon familiar Tinkerbell the Noseless
- Sarvithas, Brok, Spring Onion & Mishka attempt to flee into the forest but are followed by Cradlefall + 2 redcaps
- Spring Onion + Mishka successfully hide
- Sarvithash + Brok attempt to convince him they didn't come from Loomlurch with terrible terrible lies that don't convince him but do confuse him
- Sarvithash + Brok play cards with a redcap, winning the game, it was so angry that it lose that it instantly died
- Pippin sends Noseless to find Will of the Feywild with a note telling him we have rescued some children and where to find us
- Thalia examines the magical circle and determines that we're in a Demiplane (domain of delight), with an initial magical source being overtaken by a new strain now dominating it.
- The trio manage to kill the other red cap with relative ease, leaving the area before the dragon returns
- Children tell us:
	- Scabatha keeps treasures in the dolls house where she sleeps
	- You can get to the bedroom by climbing out a window in [[Loomlurch#Tower Two]] and across a branch
	- One of the kids stole a dust of corrosion (good against metal)
	- Narl has an imprint for the key for the kitchen
- The trio trick the dragon after it chases after them with a silent illusion of Mishka which it attacks
- dragon deeeeeeeeeead

### Summary
The group was divided in two, with [[Thalia Evergreen|Thalia]] and the recently un-gemmed [[Pippin]] escorting the group of rescued children and [[Spring Onion]], [[Brok Runebasher|Brok]] and [[Sarvithash]] with [[Mishka]] and the paintings fleeing from [[Skabatha Nightshade|Scabatha]]'s trailing forces. [[Thalia Evergreen|Thalia]] and [[Pippin]] had a lovely time, easily navigating the forest, herding the children and a sheep with candy, and meeting [[Pippin]]'s new pseudo-dragon familiar who was christened "Tinkerbell the Noseless" in honour of the nose-less dwarf who helped [[Thalia Evergreen|Thalia]]. Tinkerbell helped scout the woods and they painlessly made their way to the pre-agreed meeting point at the [[Mushroom Circle]]. [[Pippin]] sends his familiar to find [[Will of the Feywild]] with a note explaining they have rescued some children from [[Skabatha Nightshade|Scabatha]] and want to meet.

Meanwhile, [[Spring Onion]] and [[Mishka]] hide from [[Skabatha Nightshade|Scabatha]]'s pet dragon wyrmling [[Cradlefall]] who was chasing them along with two red caps. [[Sarvithash]] and [[Brok Runebasher|Brok]] instead stay in the open and attempt to convince [[Cradlefall]] that they hadn't just come from [[Loomlurch]], in a brazen series of lies that do not convince him but do confuse him. While [[Cradlefall]] wanders off to look for [[Mishka]], they play cards with the red caps, one of whom got so angry at losing he died on the spot. A fight breaks out with them easily killing the second red cap. Before [[Cradlefall]] catches up with them, [[Spring Onion]] creates a silent illusion of [[Mishka]] which tricks him into attacking it, giving everyone else the jump on him which allows them to unleash a flurry of spells that kill him extremely dead.
