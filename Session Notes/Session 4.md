### Plan
Plan for the session here.

### Notes
- Pocket watch
	- Conjuration
	- Shows miniature painting of carnival, ticking only I can hear
	- Casts shadows with henge allowing the tracking of time
	- Requires attunement
	- Allows for packing and unpacking of carnival
- Witch & Light don’t think the wishes go to Zybylna, something to do with mining & stone
- Try and find the allocorn and free the dormant queen at last
- Mind the dormant 3, future, present, past
- Allocorn is like a unicorn, lions tail, more beastial
- Haregon bandits try to collect the feeling of delight of receiving the best gift we’ve ever received
