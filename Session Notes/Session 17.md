### Plan
Plan for the session here.

### Notes
- [[Spring Onion]] opens door to outside, finds dragon [[Cradlefall]], nopes out and runs back to kitchen
- Living compost heap is a shambling mound, not quite awakened, not quite undead, eats travellers
- [[Brok Runebasher|Brok]] fights two tin men
- Thalia sets bridge on fire and gives children flammable oil to further ignite it
- [[Sarvithash]] smashes [[Miska]]'s shackles, [[Miska]] convinces them to steal stuff from [[Skabatha Nightshade|Scabatha]]'s room
- [[Grungul]] bursts from the gem part way through
- [[Sarvithash]] somehow convinces [[Cradlefall]] that he is [[Chucklehead]] and that he's rescuing [[Miska]] from the fire.
- Bushes are mimics
- Children do not throw the oil far. Bridge is very on fire by the time the tin men get there and they have no intelligence so just walk through it.
- [[Grungul]] does 55 damage to a mimic in one turn7
- [[Grungul]] dies trying rescue a pig. Lasted 30 seconds
