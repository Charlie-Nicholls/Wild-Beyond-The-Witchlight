### Plan
Plan for the session here.

### Notes
- [[Spring Onion]] opens door to outside, finds dragon [[Cradlefall]], nopes out and runs back to kitchen
- Living compost heap is a shambling mound, not quite awakened, not quite undead, eats travellers
- [[Brok Runebasher|Brok]] fights two tin men
- Thalia sets bridge on fire and gives children flammable oil to further ignite it
- [[Sarvithash Baalfulgur]] smashes [[Mishka]]'s shackles, [[Mishka]] convinces them to steal stuff from [[Skabatha Nightshade|Scabatha]]'s room
- [[Grungul]] bursts from the gem part way through
- [[Sarvithash Baalfulgur]] somehow convinces [[Cradlefall]] that he is [[Chucklehead]] and that he's rescuing [[Mishka]] from the fire.
- Bushes are mimics
- Children do not throw the oil far. Bridge is very on fire by the time the tin men get there and they have no intelligence so just walk through it.
- [[Grungul]] does 55 damage to a mimic in one turn7
- [[Grungul]] dies trying rescue a pig. Lasted 30 seconds

### Summary
We began the session with [[Spring Onion]] and [[Sarvithash Baalfulgur]] with the paintings in a Sporran of holding, an item we all definitely all knew what it was. [[Spring Onion]] picked a lock to an outside door, left, saw the Dragon [[Cradlefall]] pop out and immediately turned around and went back in and directed them through the kitchen instead. [[Brok Runebasher|Brok]] was halfway up the central tower, and left to fight two tin men. [[Thalia Evergreen|Thalia]] was attempting to escort the kids she had taken to the forest, deciding the responsible thing to do was to light a bridge on fire and give the children some flammable oil to throw on it while she left to retrieve more children. [[Sarvithash Baalfulgur]] smashed [[Mishka]]'s shackles, [[Mishka]] then attempted to convince them to steal more stuff from [[Skabatha Nightshade]] before leaving, but this was eventually decided against. 

A [[Grungul|nose-less dwarf]] burst from the gem beside [[Thalia Evergreen|Thalia]] as some bushes and a mound came to life and went after the children that had set off the pumpkin alarm, he shouted incoherently and went after the animated plants swinging a pickaxe. Thalia was left confused, but ultimately decided not to question it. By this point, Scabatha had clowed in on [[Brok Runebasher|Brok]] but before she could capture him, he jumped out of a window and slid down a tree branch to the outside where he met with [[Spring Onion]] and [[Sarvithash Baalfulgur]], who had somehow convinced the dragon that he was [[Chucklehead]] and needed to rescue [[Mishka]] from the various fires we had started which by this point had collapsed the bridge the legion of tin men had decided to walk across despite it very clearly being extremely on fire.

The [[Grungul|dwarf]] proceeded to absolutely decimate the various animated plants while [[Thalia Evergreen|Thalia]] ran to the last set of children. She had promised one of the children to rescue a small pig, but since it was surrounded by the bushes, she could see were really mimics, she ultimately decided maybe it was fine to lie to the child. As everyone escaped into the woods with the paintings and rescued children, they left the [[Grungul|dwarf]] (that only [[Thalia Evergreen|Thalia]] saw and never learned the name of) to go down swinging to the mound and [[Skabatha Nightshade|Scabatha]] to rethink her system of defending her very large tree base with creatures with almost no mobility.
