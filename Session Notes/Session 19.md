### Plan
Plan for the session here.

### Notes
- Bird from Will leads us to a small lake-y thing. Has a small island in the middle.
- Bad weather and thickening brush, presumably from annoying scabatha, comes, but stops at the shore of the lake.
- If we bathe in the lake for 1 min we can lose a level of exhaustion, end a curse or attunement to a cursed item.
- Unicord is called Lamora
- 4 Pictures, 3 hourglass hags, one other hag, and Tasha, Lamora + Will identify final hag as Babayaga, mother of witches
- Found the displacer beast kitten
- Orc wants to kill unicorn to free, ringlerun, to steal his staff
- Orc works for the Leader of the League of Male Violence (Malevolence), Kalek, who knows how to use the unicorn horn to break the spell of temporal stasis
- The whole palace was frozen, including Zybilna & Ringlerun
- Using Elodin's Horn for the spell shouldnt have destroyed him
- LONG REST, PORTENT: 6, 1
