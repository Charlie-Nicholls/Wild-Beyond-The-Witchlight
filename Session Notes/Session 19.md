### Plan
Plan for the session here.

### Notes
- Bird from Will leads us to a small lake-y thing. Has a small island in the middle.
- Bad weather and thickening brush, presumably from annoying scabatha, comes, but stops at the shore of the lake.
- If we bathe in the lake for 1 min we can lose a level of exhaustion, end a curse or attunement to a cursed item.
- Unicorn is called Lamora
- 4 Pictures, 3 hourglass hags, one other hag, and Tasha, Lamora + Will identify final hag as Babayaga, mother of witches
- Found the displacer beast kitten
- Orc wants to kill unicorn to free, ringlerun, to steal his staff
- Orc works for the Leader of the League of Male Violence (Malevolence), Kalek, who knows how to use the unicorn horn to break the spell of temporal stasis
- The whole palace was frozen, including Zybilna & Ringlerun
- Using Elodin's Horn for the spell shouldnt have destroyed him
- LONG REST, PORTENT: 6, 1

### Summary
The party, still split in two, are each met by a bird, sent by [[Will of the Feywild]]. It lead us through bad weather and thickening brush to a lake, at the centre of which is a small island. The lake has a tendency to turn around those who approach it, unless they are pretending to be a unicorn. On crossing the lake, we heal the exhaustion that has set in from lack of rest. At the centre of the lake we meet [[Will of the Feywild|Will]], who appears to most as an energetic child, but to [[Thalia Evergreen|Thalia]] and [[Dapple Elfstree]]'s *True Sight* he appeared as a blue giant. With him are a unicorn, [[Lamora]], a living tree, several rescued children and the kitten of [[Spring Onion]]'s displacer beast friend.

With enough time to examine them properly, we retrieved the stolen portraits for a closer look. Finding there is one each of [[Bavlorna Blightstraw|Bavlorna]], [[Skabatha Nightshade|Scabatha]], [[Endelyn Moonshade|Endelyn]], [[Tasha]] and finally the mother of witches [[Babayaga]]. But as we were doing this, an orc burst from the bushes and attacked [[Lamora]]. Fortunately, he posed little threat on his own. While his hiding in the bushes and potion of invisibility made him initially hard to locate, once he was found he was quickly captured. On interrogation he claimed he worked for the "League of Male Violence", although [[Lamora]] believes he means the "League of Malevolence", and that his leader [[Kalek]] wanted a unicorn horn to break the spell of temporal stasis that holds the palace and their ally [[Ringlerun]]. [[Lamora]] reveals another unicorn, [[Elodin]], had their horn used for the initial freezing but that this shouldn't have destroyed the horn. Everyone then rested while [[Dapple Elfstree]] took first watch, noticing [[Boggy]] and [[Wolly Junior]]'s sheep had sneaked away.
