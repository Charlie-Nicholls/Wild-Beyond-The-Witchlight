### Summary
We began by scouting out [[Loomlurch]] to plan for the heist with [[Ruach]]'s owl familiar and [[Dapple]] wildshaped as a spider. Finding one tower with two guards and a sick child, one tower contained the paintings on the bottom floor and two further guards on top, between the two towers were rooms with the [[Pig Mask Girl]] imprisoned and a room of trinkets and the final tower had [[Skabatha Nightshade|Scabatha]]'s dollhouse and study. 

[[Sarvithash]], [[Dapple]] and [[Spring Onion]] sneaked in through the kitchen with [[Sarvithash]] disguised as [[Chucklehead]] with [[Spring Onion]] in his backpack and [[Dapple]] once again a spider. In the kitchen was a small pet dragon and another child. [[Spring Onion]] managed to pick the lock whilst on [[Sarvithash]]'s back as distracted the dragon, giving them access to the paintings. The paintings were surrounded with magical thorns but they managed to cut them out of their frame. 

Meanwhile, [[Ruach]] traded for some flammable and slippery oils, then attempted to cause a distraction by setting the goblin stalls on fire from behind a tree. [[Brok Runebasher|Brok]] and [[Ruach]] then stormed the [[Loomlurch#Workshop]] and freed three children, who [[Thalia Evergreen|Thalia]] has taken to the edge of the forest. [[Ruach]] and [[Brok Runebasher|Brok]] continued up the tower to the sick children, with [[Ruach]] teleporting past the guards to retrieve the children with a bit of help from [[Brok Runebasher|Brok]]'s healing magic. Managing to take them down the outside of the tower, past some scarecrows who have sounded the alarm.
