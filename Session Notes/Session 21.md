### Summary
[[Wolly Junior]] and [[Brok Runebasher|Brok]] emerged from [[The Gem]] after [[Side Quest 1]] with the lost things of [[Lothar]] and [[Vick]]. A demon slaying battle axe and some magical pan pipes. The group reached [[Loomlurch]] and begun to execute the plan to retrieve the lost things from [[Skabatha Nightshade|Scabatha]]'s doll's house. Two Redcaps were guarding the garden; [[Pippin Mantel]] turned invisible and stood between them shouting, in an attempt to get them so angry they either die on the spot, or fight
