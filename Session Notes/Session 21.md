Plan for the session here.

### Notes
- PORTENT: 6 (Used), 1 (Used), Dangerous Portent (17)
- Wolly & Brok emerge from the gem with the lost things of [[Lothar]] and [[Vick]], a demon slaying battle axe and magical pan pipes.
- Pippin attempts to make the redcaps angry with each other, they fight
- Scabatha shouts at the red caps, wolly believes it's a dragon and charges, thalia convinces wolly's sheep to tell scabatha the party is trying to infiltrate the workshop, and portent's Scabatha's insight to a nat 1
- Thalia gives spring onion some anti-gravity bubblegum and he and pippin's pseudodragon fly in through scabatha's bedroom window
- Will runs around to make a feint for the workshop & smash the window
- Brok follows wolly and attempts to hide in a tree, but heavy armour and a flaming battleaxe make stealth difficuly
- Wolly annihilates the undead halfling with wings (from the carnival)
